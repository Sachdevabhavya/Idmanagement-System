# ID Management System

The ID Management System is a backend application developed using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It facilitates the creation and management of student ID cards commonly used in colleges and schools. This system allows administrators to enter detailed information for each student, which is then stored in a MongoDB database. Additionally, the system generates a virtual ID card for each student, complete with a QR code for easy access to student information.

## Features

- **Student ID Creation:** Administrators can create student ID cards by entering all necessary details.
- **Data Storage:** All student details are securely stored in a MongoDB database for easy retrieval and management.
- **Virtual ID Cards:** The system generates virtual ID cards for each student, providing a convenient way to access their information.
- **QR Code Generation:** A unique QR code is generated for each student, facilitating quick scanning and access to their details.
- **Image Upload:** Administrators can upload images for each student to be included on their ID cards.
